            Graduated from the <span style="color: rgb(29, 51, 106); font-weight: bold;">University of North Carolina, Greensboro</span> in
            2016 with a
            <span style="color: rgb(198, 198, 29); font-weight: bold;">Bachelor of Science
                degree in Sports Medicine.</span>  After upon completion, I have decided to take some time
            off to work and put some thoughts to my decision to see whether if I really want to continue my eduction and pursue a career in the health and fitness field 
            or find a new career path. 
            During the time, I work in manufacturing jobs such as <strong>GKN</strong>  and <strong>Corning Inc.</strong> while still figuring out
            my pursuit.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thereafter, I was introduce to coding by a close friend who is a web developer and he recommended me to give it a try with web development, and maybe it can change my
            life like it did his.
            I took interest, and decided to search online for coding bootcamps.
            I have decided to change my career and pursue coding. I attended the 
                <strong style="color: rgb(23, 120, 23);">UNCC Full-Time Full Stack Developer</strong> bootcamp in 2019,
            with the aspiration of becoming a software engineer/web developer after graduation.

                About 3 months after completing my bootcamp, I took an opportunity with <strong style="color: rgb(39, 109, 173);">Cognixia's JuMP </strong>program , which is a 6 weeks 
                hire-train-deploy opportunity that helps students  with a computer science degree or background further their knowledge and get a job. I have completed the program, 
                but unfortunately, I was not one of the chosen 
                candidates for their clients.

                Currently, I am looking for an entry-junior software development/engineering full-time or contract opportunities, preferably in the Charlotte and Raleigh, NC area.
                While actively seeking for opportunities, I am advancing my knowledge at home using <br>

                and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="../../assets/icons/i-youtube.png" style="padding: 0 6px;">YouTube</span> as my learning resouces.
                I am currently working on advancing my previous skills in  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">C#, ASP.NET CORE, Angular, and MySQL</span> .
